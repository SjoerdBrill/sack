		give information about what
		type of controls/data a synth needs (ie this.synths.at(\synthDefName).controls), but
		should the mapping of different control sources to running synths be handled by
		other parts of the program? need to know what sort of argument the play method is
		supposed to get from SACKSequencer or SACKControl
		should the argument be a very general specification of which buses/streams go where
		and then the play method connects them all up before playing the synth?
